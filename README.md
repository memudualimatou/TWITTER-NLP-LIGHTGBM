PROBLEM OF STATEMENT
ML-driven sentiment analysis is an important tool to understand communities’ feelings around major issues such as COVID-19.
Gathering comprehensive social data for sentiment analysis can be limited, however, if data collection relies only on keywords such as ‘coronavirus’ or ‘covid’.

The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to assess if a Twitter post is about COVID-19 or not. 
This model will help gather tweet data about the epidemic without relying only on key words like ‘covid’ or ‘coronavirus’ being present, allowing researchers and engineers to gather a more comprehensive dataset for sentiment analysis.
